Database Connection: Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database to retrieve the xDR data using a SQL query.
Data Loading: Load the data into a DataFrame for analysis.
Data Cleaning:
Missing Values: Identify and treat missing values using a dedicated function to generate a summary of missing data.
Data Type Conversion: Convert relevant columns to appropriate data types, such as converting bytes to megabytes for easier interpretation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, etc.) to understand the distribution of key variables.
Visualization: Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the data, such as histograms and box plots, to identify patterns and outliers.
User Behavior Analysis:
Aggregation: Aggregate data to analyze user behavior across different applications (e.g., YouTube, Netflix) by calculating metrics like session duration and total data usage.
Segmentation: Segment users based on their engagement metrics and usage patterns.
Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction:
K-Means Clustering: Apply K-Means clustering to categorize users into different engagement groups based on their usage metrics.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Conduct PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, helping to identify key factors influencing user behavior.
Experience and Satisfaction Analysis:
Experience Metrics: Analyze network parameters (e.g., TCP retransmission, RTT, throughput) to assess user experience.
Satisfaction Scores: Calculate satisfaction scores based on engagement and experience metrics, using Euclidean distance to measure proximity to clusters.
Modeling and Prediction:
Regression Analysis: Develop regression models to predict customer satisfaction based on engagement and experience scores.
Dashboard Development:
Visualization Tools: Create an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights and metrics, ensuring usability and clarity for end-users.
Conclusion
This structured methodology allows for a comprehensive analysis of TellCo's data, providing actionable insights that can inform the investor's decision on the potential acquisition of the company. The steps taken ensure that the analysis is thorough, data-driven, and aligned with the business objectives."""

    # Report Results
    with report_tabs[3]:
        st.header("Results")
        results_text = """Data Loading:
The dataset was successfully loaded from a PostgreSQL database using a SQL query, retrieving all records from the xdr_data table.
Data Overview:
The DataFrame contains 150,000 rows and 55 columns. The first few rows display various attributes, including:
Bearer Id
Start and End Times
Duration (ms)
IMSI, MSISDN/Number, IMEI
Data Volumes for applications like YouTube, Netflix, and Gaming.
Missing Values:
A significant number of columns have missing values:
41 columns contain missing data.
For example, the column "Nb of sec with 37500B < Vol UL" has 130,254 missing values, representing 86.8% of total values.
Data Types:
The DataFrame consists of various data types, including float64 for numerical values and object for categorical data (e.g., "Last Location Name," "Handset Type").
Data Conversion:
A function was applied to convert bytes to megabytes for easier interpretation of data usage metrics.
Data Inspection:
The initial inspection of the DataFrame shows the first five rows, providing a glimpse into the structure and content of the dataset.
Conclusion
The analysis indicates that the dataset contains rich information about user behavior and application usage, but it also highlights significant gaps due to missing values. This foundational data will be crucial for further exploratory data analysis (EDA), user engagement analysis, and experience analytics as part of the overall assessment of TellCo's growth potential.
The next steps would involve addressing the missing values and conducting deeper analyses to derive actionable insights for the investor's decision-making process"""

The analysis revealed that the dataset contains a significant number of missing values across various columns, with 41 out of 55 columns having missing data. This highlights potential issues with data integrity that need to be addressed before further analysis.
Data Structure:
The dataset comprises 150,000 rows and 55 columns, capturing comprehensive user activity and application usage metrics, which are crucial for understanding customer behavior.
Initial Insights:
Preliminary data inspection indicates a rich dataset that can provide valuable insights into user behavior and application usage patterns. However, the high percentage of missing values, particularly in key metrics, could skew results and affect the reliability of conclusions drawn from the data.
Next Steps:
It is essential to clean the data by addressing the missing values and outliers before conducting deeper exploratory data analysis (EDA) and further statistical evaluations. This will enhance the robustness of the findings and ensure that subsequent analyses are based on high-quality data.
Potential for Growth:
Despite the data quality issues, the dataset holds significant potential for uncovering growth opportunities within TellCo, particularly by analyzing customer engagement and satisfaction metrics.
Overall Recommendation
The analysis suggests that while there are challenges related to data completeness, the dataset's potential insights warrant further investigation. The next steps should focus on data cleaning and preparation to enable a thorough analysis that can inform strategic decisions regarding the acquisition of TellCo."""
